This is my final year project that i completed with my other two group members. The main aim of this project was to streamline the intial recruitment process using large language model. We targeted the software engineering field and trained LLAMA 2 model on a huge collection of data to train our chatbot and make it ready to conduct interviews. We developed a user-friendly web application that had two kind of users, job seekers and job hiring companies. For developing web application we used React JS for frontend and Django for backend API development and integration and PostgreSQL for database design and management.
